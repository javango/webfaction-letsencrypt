Fully Automated Let's Encrypt integration for WebFaction

Work In Progress for a fully automated solution to get Let's Encrypt setup for Web Faction.

This scrupt will create a new application that is shared by all websites,  this application will be mounted at /.well-known for each website,  the script will then use acme.sh to update the certificate

# Status

This script is not ready for use,  it is close but has not been tested

# TODO

Currently the script will create the letsencrypt webfaction application,  associate this appliation with the proper URLs and create the certificates,  all that exists for basic functionality is to update the website to use the certififcate.

# HOWTO

Copy the user_config.py.example and update with your user/password
